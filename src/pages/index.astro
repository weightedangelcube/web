		I'm <b>angelcube</b>, and I make games.	
	</p>
	<p>
		my tools include Java and C#; I'm also familliar with the Fabric toolchain for Minecraft, and the Godot game engine and API.
	</p>
	<p>
		beyond coding, I love to sing, do a little drawing, and obsess over video games—currently, I'm plagued by my love of <a href="https://www.celestegame.com/"><b>Celeste</b></a>.
